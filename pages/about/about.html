  <h2>Exam Preparation Fall 2022</h2>
  <p>A (highly) suggested way to prepare for the exam  is via this exercise.

    You should take it as a representative example of the complexity you can expect for  the 24 hours exam (obviously it will be a completely different domain you have to implement)
    
    The overall idea is to create a reservation system for a simple library
    
    Initially the product owner has come up with this simple domain model, which models most of what  is relevant for this exercise.
    Observe that book has been given an ID, so the library can handle more than one copy of the book (should obviously be normalised for a real project)
    Focus on loans first, and continue with Reservation only if you have time.
    
    Implement as many of the requirements below, as you can handle. Make sure to include both client- and server-side code for ALL the following (skip parts in parentheses if you find this exercise hard)
    
    Include all the CRUD operations for Book. Use hard coded data for Members.
    Include a way to let a member Loan a book. Verify that it's not already borrowed.
    (add a check for whether the book is reserved first)
    Include a way to let a Member return a book
    (include a way to "signal" that the book was not returned in time when returned)
    Show a list with all borrowed books
    Show a list with all borrowed books that have exceeded the due date
